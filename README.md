## Problem Statement
Predict whether a customer will churn (leave) a service based on their usage patterns and demographics.

## Approach
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize data distributions and correlations.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Setting up a data pipeline, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, normalize data.
3. **Model Training**: Train a Random Forest classifier.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using accuracy and classification report.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the model using Flask and Azure Web Services.
